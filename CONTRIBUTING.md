# Contributing to Joseph’s Portfolio

Thanks for considering contributing! This is my personal portfolio, but I’m happy to accept improvements that keep it clean, fast, and beautiful.

### What I’m open to
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Modern shadcn/ui component upgrades
- Subtle, tasteful animations (Framer Motion only)
- SEO / Open Graph enhancements
- Bug fixes (especially on Safari or weird screen sizes)

### What I’ll probably decline
- Light mode
- Emoji overload
- Flashy effects or 3D blobs
- Changing the color palette (cyan/blue gradient stays)
- Adding heavy libraries

### How to contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Keep it under 1000 lines if possible
5. Run `pnpm build` → should succeed with no errors
6. Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description

I review PRs usually within 24–48 hours.

Let’s keep this portfolio the cleanest on the internet.
